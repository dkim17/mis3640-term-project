#Term Project Proposal: Web Scraping 
Team members: Jonghyun Park and Donghyun Kim

## 1. Main Goal
•   By utitlizing Scraping tools, being able to collect and scrape babson academic course data. From that process, it enables us to completely understand how scraping tools work in order to scrape the data. Also, the collected data could be used in various situations that requires our school courses. 

## 2. Learning Goals 
•	How to deal with list and groups and match right variables
•	List and groups will be very important for our project because our main subject will be the Babson courses. Listing and grouping them properly will be our main goal to achieve this project.  
•	How to scrape the course listing to python from the Babson website
•	Able to analyze the address on Babson course listing and put it into the program. 
•	Able to understand the whole coding and utilize the same coding for different work/project. 
•	This project should be the stepping stone for us to understand python more deeply and by accomplish this project, we should be able to apply the same knowledge when we have different types of work/project with python. 
•	Collaborative mindset / work
•	Able to share what each person has researched and learned
•	Able to disperse the work effectively while working together as a group
•	The point of working as a group is to accomplish work more effectively. Collaborative mindset/work on this project will not only be helpful for this assignment but also be helpful for our future project. 
•	 Developing strategy to identify problems and solve them
•	Identifying problem is the most important thing to do. While working on this project, we will going to face a lot of problems and by able to identify them and solve them, it will be easier for our group to finish the project. 

## 3. Implementation Plan
•	Find out which scraping tools/package that we will going to use 
•	Fully understand how this scraping process works with that specific tool
•   Figure out the specific way to scrape the data (Find the pattern)	
•   Code it and run it	

## 4. Project Schedule: 
Original Plan
•	Week 1: gather list of courses and number of credits
•	Week 2: we are going to ask some questions to peers regarding any inconvenience they experienced when they look up information of courses.
•	Week 3: make Final decision which information is necessary and unnecessary and begin to design our program.
•	Week 4 & 5: Building systems and check any errors in our coding
•	Week 6: Check any errors and pre-run the program
•	Week 7: Finalize
•	Week 8: Review and submit
Revised Plan
•	Week 1: Reserach on Scraping tools
•	Week 2: Choose scraping tools
•	Week 3: Find out how to run the code 
•	Week 4 & 5: Run the code and discover any problems  
•	Week 6: Thanksgiving break 
•	Week 7: Struggling to advance the code 
•	Week 8: Website building and finalize project

## 5. Collaboration plan: 
•	We are going to do whole task together. 
•	We are going to meet at least once a week and check our progress. 
•	After we finished coding, we will review together
•	We are going to divide into two parts in searching for codes related to our project, then we are going to share what we found and learned.

## 6. Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project? 
•	Our understanding of coding. 
•	When we have to do more than we learn
•	Also we need to find where errors occurred, but we don’t have enough knowledge on finding and fixing errors 
•	Time management
•	With teammates 
•	With our current school schedule
•	How to overcome long Thanksgiving break and finish the work in time 
•	Getting enough materials for this project
•	Getting right course list and able to scrape it
