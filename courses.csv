The writer uses dialogue, description, setting, characterization, rhythm, sound and form to express active thinking on page.  Incorporating these diverse elements into an essay allows the writer to imagine, question, contradict and complicate subject matter.  In class, we will move through several exercises to hone our skills towards writing essays and will work collaboratively in offering feedback.  Writing Creative Non-fiction allows the writer great freedom to develop both their ideas and their writing skills.

We will consider the implications of global interdependence and the increasingly robust international judicial system for the principles and practice of public international law.  Does international law actually create global order, or does it merely reflect political order that exists in other settings?  When should national sovereignty and domestic prerogatives yield to international law and the desires of the global community?  What is the proper role of non-state actors (multinational businesses, NGOs, advocacy groups) in this global legal regime?These questions (and many others) have been at the center of the quest to create global order in a rapidly changing world where the pace of technological innovation, personal and business entrepreneurship, and the increasingly free movement of people, capital, and ideas often far outpace the capacity of any legal regime (domestic or international) to keep up.  We will study these issues and related themes throughout the semester.  Special emphasis is placed on the application of public international law to international institutions, human rights (including the intersection of human rights with transnational business), the legal regulation of warfare (including “humanitarian” intervention and responses to global terrorism), the global environment and high seas, transnational dispute settlement, and business ethics in the global setting.      Prerequisite: Foundation Law course, (LAW1000)   This course is typically offered in the following semester: Fall",Accounting and Law,"Dec 15, 2018",31 of 30,31,"Nersessian, David",Luksic 101,Undergraduate,01, Fall 2018,Full Session,"Aug 29, 2018",2018,11:30AM- 1:05PM,Fall,PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW

This course investigates the relationship between ecological systems and high density areas of the human population. We will begin by discovering the nature within cities. Frequently when discussing nature, far-off lands of pristine wilderness are envisioned, but these people-less areas are inaccessible and often not relatable for much of the population. Many of the vital ecosystem services for which human life depends are derived from under-appreciated urban habitats. We will also investigate global human demography trends and socio-economic patterns within cities. The course then focuses on envisioning cities as integrated social-ecological systems. Cities and the people who live in them consume land, water, and energy resources that often originate outside the city’s boundaries. Air, water, and solid waste pollution are also produced and distributed widely.

Nature provides us with an incredible amount of research and development for effective problem-solving methodologies with the ultimate test for organisms being survival of the fittest. For the past 3.8 billion years, life has evolved strategies that are constantly integrated and optimized to create conditions conducive for life to continue. When biomimicry is well done, it is not just imitation, but rather inspiration using the design principles that nature has shown to be successful. Interest in biomimicry has expanded quickly and according to a recent Forbes article, “biomimicry patents, scholarly articles and research grants have increased by more than five times since 2000. By 2030, the field could account for $425 billion of US GDP and $1.6 trillion of total global output, [the Fermanian Business & Economic Institute] estimates.” In this course we will begin by investigating life’s principles and applying them to specific product design strategies by asking questions like “How does nature make color?” and “How does nature water-proof something?” The second half of the course will then emphasize ecosystem design to understand how we can use inspiration from ecological function and interconnectedness as a way to solve problems in businesses and organizations. We will focus on understanding the biology, chemistry, physics and ecology of nature’s designs in order to apply them to both product and process design.

While the problems afflicting the poor are great, there is power in thinking small - how a simple, focused innovation can change an individual life, a personal choice or a system. Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) is an international, experiential social entrepreneurship and design course where students work in partnership with communities in India, Ghana, Morocco and Alabama to co-create and test innovation concepts and sustainable business models. The focus is on income generation and meeting daily human needs through new product and service design and development but the scope considers the cultural appropriateness of design choices and their impact on social venture success. This includes how design can impact the desirability and viability of innovations in different problem-opportunity contexts, examined in the innovation phases of observation, conception, strategic planning and implementation.A joint offering by Babson and Olin College, the course integrates core elements of user-oriented collaborative design and engineering design with entrepreneurial opportunity shaping and venture strategy. Babson and Olin College students work collaboratively in cross-functional teams to exploit their respective expertise and strengths. Starting with ethnographic research, venture teams collaborate first-hand with local communities on focused issues to identify addressable problems and to evaluate and test potential innovation solutions. Mixing entrepreneurship and design pedagogies, the course takes a systems view considering how design choices in product/service design and business model design can enhance-or diminish-a social venture's impact.The course is run as a virtual firm where students work on distributed teams to develop social ventures by engaging with partner organizations, prioritizing programs, and setting and pursing goals while deploying modest amounts of seed capital. The course is time-intensive but rich and immersive. Students travel once per semester to partner sites to build relationships, learn about local culture, understand and map needs, identify stakeholders, perform experiments and tests, and collect information on local infrastructure and value chains.(a)  Prerequisites:    FME1000, EPS3501, Junior standing",Entrepreneurial Sts,"Dec 15, 2018",15 of 15,15,"Bida, Craig",Weissman Foundry 103,Undergraduate,01, Fall 2018,Full Session,"Sep 4, 2018",2018, 3:30PM- 6:30PM 3:30PM- 5:30PM,Fall,AFFORDABLE DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Many organizations are now interested in capturing, distributing and applying the knowledge of their employees for business benefit. Also, companies need to keep track of knowledge outside of their corporate walls, for example, understanding market trends and being aware of what customers are saying about their products. Ultimately, the goal of Enterprise 2.0 is to break down traditional information silos and allow employees and managers to tap into the right people and expertise when they need it. In this course we will discuss the current state of the Enterprise 2.0 movement. We will also explore how social collaboration tools (often referred to as social media and Web 2.0) are being used by organizations to leverage the ""wisdom of the crowds."" Organizations are increasingly using tools such as blogs, wikis, social tagging, and social networking tools to achieve emergent collaboration and to break down information silos. Knowledge workers are also using social technologies to build their personal brand and personal network. Student projects will emphasize a “hands-on” approach to understanding the latest social technologies. We will use social network analysis (SNA) software, a methodology to analyze the structure of social networks, or the people-to-people connections in organizations. SNA is an increasingly popular application used by both management consultants and internal organizational practices (e.g., knowledge management, IS, HR, R&D) to understand information flows and “influencers” inside and outside a company. Another project will have students create a social media campaign for an organization, including providing metrics on how to evaluate the success of the campaign. We will also experiment with mobile applications, such as location-based services (e.g., Foursquare, SCVNGR) on smartphones.

During each in-class session, the students will be exposed to a new TPS concept and discuss how to implement it at their project. The students will also provide and receive feedback from their peers, instructors, and guest lecturers to gain insights on their implementation attempts to-date, thus better understanding their assigned problem and charting a path forward to success.    The partner organizations are from a wide variety of industries, including technology, consumer products, food, legal services, and socially-oriented manufacturing and service companies.                 Prerequisites: FME and SME (except SME2041); Juniors and Seniors status","Technology, Operations & Info Mgt","Dec 15, 2018",21 of 20,21,"Glover, Wiljeana",Weissman Foundry 103,Undergraduate,01, Fall 2018,Full Session,"Aug 29, 2018",2018,11:30AM- 1:05PM,Fall,SCALING LEAN VENTURES

Sustainability thinking challenges entrepreneurial leaders to enable the transition to a sustainable economic system, by identifying business opportunities and leading transformation of business culture. Students will learn about the systemic view of sustainability on how organizations can create social value while simultaneously delivering realistic economic returns: repurpose, stakeholder involvement, design & implementation of innovations and metrics development. Students will develop practical knowledge and skillset from design thinking and systems thinking as integral disciplines to manage human, financial, and other resources in innovations that transform businesses. Our goal is to provide the basis for a common language and understanding of the intersection between environmental/social issues and sustainability, innovation and entrepreneurship, business strategy, and organizational culture. Ultimately, students will develop their understanding of how to lead the transformation of a conventional business into a sustainable business. The course is composed of four parts. The first part will give students an overview of the sustainability thinking and allied strategy and the tools for designing the process through which it happens: what dimensions and questions might be considered to evaluate and guide sustainability. Having identified both the challenges and tools associated with sustainability, the second part will make the case for making a product or service sustainable. The third part will shift the discussion to making an organization sustainable and characteristics of sustainability leaders. Finally, the fourth part will reflect on making your life sustainable.

With the rapid expansion of globalization, and the attenuating crises that accompany it, with regard to these concerns, future business and public policy leaders will need to be in the vanguard at determining how best to effect solutions. To that end, this course will examine a variety of sources in the consideration both of what allows for the implementation of sustainability and what prohibits it--from business case study to philosophical/economic analysis to literary memoir.  Within this context, students will be invited to examine what we mean when we talk about ""justice,"" ""ethics,"" ""profit,"" ""growth,"" and ""community.""  In sum, we will explore how concepts that contribute to our understanding of individual and communal responsibility might be revisited and redefined in the effort to create a world that offers sustainable economic opportunity for all, ensured within a vital commitment to environmental stewardship.    Prerequisites:  RHT and AHSThis course may be offered Spring or a Summer semester",Arts & Humanities,"Dec 15, 2018",25 of 30,25,"Graham, Michelle",Tomasso 107,Undergraduate,01, Fall 2018,Full Session,"Aug 29, 2018",2018,11:30AM- 1:05PM,Fall,NARRATIVES OF SUSTAINABILITY

But what exactly is the American Dream?  What are its tenets?  Who gets to enjoy it?  This course will examine how both male and female playwrights such as Susan Glaspell, Clifford Odets, Lorraine Hansberry, Sam Shepard, and Wendy Wasserstein have answered these questions in their dramatizations of the American Dream.  As we study and watch various performances of the American Dream, we will take into account the voice telling the story and question the authority, privilege, and experience of that voice.  We will evaluate how the plays speak to the American Dream, to each other, and to us.  This course will require two papers, a mid-term and final exam.

If one is complete perfection and the other complete imperfection – both by definition unattainable – then why are the concepts even worth talking about, and why have they persisted throughout history and across cultures?

This module focuses on the internal organization and processes required for entrepreneurial leaders and managers to successfully test and execute business strategies. To be effective, entrepreneurs and managers must design operations, model the expected performance of operational designs, make decisions that strategically manage costs, and take actions that achieve desired results in an ethical manner. The two streams in this module will help build the skills you need to become ethical entrepreneurial leaders and managers. You will experience how the design of operations impacts measured performance, and how modeling expected results before action is taken leads to improved operational decisions.

The stream introduces the language of managerial accounting and teaches students to perform basic management accounting analyses (e.g., costing of cost objects, cost behavior, differential analysis, and performance measurement). The stream requires students to use the results of their analysis to evaluate the design of operations, to make strategic decisions, and to propose action. Issues covered include selecting a profitable mix of products and services, analyzing profits and costs during product development, budgeting for operations, analyzing whether to outsource or insource activities, and managing performance through measurement systems.

This course introduces you to the operational challenges that entrepreneurs and managers face and provides a set of tools to aid you in designing, evaluating and managing business processes to meet your organization’s objectives. Throughout the semester we will explore interconnections between operational actions and management accounting analyses.","Technology, Operations & Info Mgt","Dec 15, 2018",38 of 0,38,"Johnson, Brad A",Malloy 102,Undergraduate,08, Fall 2018,Full Session,"Aug 29, 2018",2018, 3:00PM- 4:15PM,Fall,OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT

The question is will it ultimately succeed in its goals of eliminating trade barriers while increasing political unity, economic growth and territorial security throughout Europe. Recent history has shown that, from the “Brexit” movement in the UK, to the rise of right-wing populism in Hungary, Poland and Italy, to the massive influx of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East, the EU now faces potentially shattering challenges to its authority and its institutions.  Can the EU survive?Students will learn about the history of the EU, its institutional structures, decision-making and legislation, the European Single Market, and Europe’s single currency, the Euro.

This course provides an introduction to the Latin American business environment, with special focus on Uruguay and Argentina. In Uruguay, we explore the dilemmas of the country’s contrasting development opportunities, promoting tourism and sustainable enterprise built on its natural beauty, while pressured to accept environmentally threatening extractive industry investments in mining, pulp, and petroleum. Additional themes include environmental and water rights debates, regional infrastructure investment, and review of South-South trade initiatives. In Argentina, we examine the country’s emergence from the volatile swings of agricultural commodity booms, international debt, and financial turbulence. We explore the challenges of the recently elected Macri government to promote economic development through entrepreneurial initiative directed by market fundamentals. What happens when entrepreneurs design government policy and roll back the state? In addition we examine regional e-business competition, the “Tango” as a cultural artifact of early economic development, concluding with an appraisal of the region’s prospects in the wake of the adversity of a global financial crisis.

Often in Western discussions of business ethics, it is assumed that the West is far ahead of Asia in business ethics.  We will make no such assumption, but rather, we will ask if Malaysia and Thailand have anything to teach our countries.More particularly, we will focus on three Asian faiths and cultural traditions – Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism.  We will visit 3 socially responsible companies, each representing, respectively, an approach to social responsibility consistent with one of those 3 traditions.

Although bandits, are by the very definition, law-breakers, their social, political, and economic role is often far more complicated. Bandits do more than just operate in the “underworld,” they often challenge the state and it’s legitimacy to rule. As a result, the bandit, and the myths and histories around them, become a lens to criticize and question the authority, or lack thereof, of the state and similar institutions throughout history. We will examine, not only the history of the bandit and the underworld, but in a deeper vein, the entanglements between licit and illicit markets, of law, police, and prison systems, of wealth and poverty, and of the the role and influence of the state in shaping the conditions that give rise to the bandit and outlaw.Prerequisite: RHT1000 and RHT1001; AHS1000 and Any combination of 3 Intermediate Liberal arts (HSS/LVA/CVA)",History & Society,"May 17, 2019",20 of 20,20,"Bradford, James", ,Undergraduate,01, Spring 2019,Full Session,"Jan 22, 2019",2019,11:30AM- 1:05PM,Spring,BANDITS:CRIME AND PUNISHMENT THROUGH HIS

Drawing on a wide variety of literature from different disciplines and regions, we will critically examine the shaping of cities across the world: Boston, London, Paris, Shanghai, Mumbai, Singapore, Dubai, Bangalore, and Brasilia among others. We will examine city-space at two levels: first, at the more formal level of the state and town planners; and, second, at an everyday level, where city dwellers contest and redraw town plans in their daily lives. The course begins with an analysis of race, class, and gender that segregated the industrial metropolis. We will then discuss colonial cities using space as a lens to review empire and imperialism. Next, our focus will be on neoliberal governance; megacities; the conceptualization of ‘community’ in a neoliberal city; gentrification; privatization of urban space; urban informality; and the new language of urban inclusion/exclusion. A specific focus of this course will be on the impact of globalization on South Asian city space: has globalization sharpened class, caste, and religious divides in these cities?Prerequisite: Any combination of 3 intermediate liberal arts (HSS, CVA, LVA) ",History & Society,"May 17, 2019",20 of 20,20,"Ghosh, Nabaparna", ,Undergraduate,01, Spring 2019,Full Session,"Jan 22, 2019",2019, 4:45PM- 7:55PM,Spring,GLOBAL CITIES

A question this significant cannot be adequately answered by any one approach, thus the course brings together two very different approaches to guide the investigation.  Psychological studies of identity marshal the tools and methods of science to develop and test theories that describe and explain the self.  Theater studies bring interpretative and aesthetic perspectives to represent and reveal identity.  In this course, these two approaches will be purposely inter-mingled: the questions asked and the answers derived will be informed equally by psychology and theater.  Students will see, on a daily basis, how each field informs, supports, and speaks to the other.  While there are some class sessions and assignments explicitly grounded in only one field to build students’ fluency, the major activities of the semester will require both.  Given how personally applicable both psychology and theater are, students’ own sense of identity will be the central text in this course.  Like Tom in The Glass Menagerie, students are both the main character in their own life stories and also the narrator of them.  This course aims for true interdisciplinary integration, and students will be called upon to use and apply the theoretical work as they build and create an original solo performance about a key moment in their lives. Our hope is that by semester’s end students will have taken a concrete step forward in understanding and articulating their sense of self and feel comfortable and confident in their ability to perform for a live, public audience. Students are asked to alternate between four roles in this course: scholar, writer, actor, and critic.•   Scholars consume information in analytical ways and produce new knowledge that is deeply grounded in their foundational knowledge.•   Writers produce new works, both analytical and creative, that take a novel position and support it.•   Actors give life to both old and new characters, conveying their shifting objectives over time to impact an audience.•   Critics evaluate texts (in our case, performances) with a constructive, thoughtful, and respectful approach that brings new insights.Some days students will only adopt one role, others students will be asked to oscillate between thethem.Prerequisites: RHT & Any combination of 3 Intermediate Liberal Arts (LVA/CVA/HSS)",Arts & Humanities,"May 17, 2019",7 of 6,7,"Wynstra, Beth", ,Undergraduate,01, Spring 2019,Full Session,"Jan 22, 2019",2019, 1:15PM- 2:50PM,Spring,CONSTRUCTING AND PERFORMING THE SELF

It appears that from an ethical and aesthetic perspective, love is most interesting when it somehow fails, is unrequited, or drives a person to despair and/or madness. Sure, love inspires, motivates us to do great things, yet what interesting novel or film deals with happy, blissful love? But in asking that question, how are we defining ""love""? Friendship, romantic love, erotic love, familial love, love of wisdom, religious love, and love of country … love's forms are many and yet we use one word to capture this wide variety of phenomena. Furthermore, people will often dispute the use of the term within a given context: what one person calls love, another may call codependency, obsession, desire, or even zealotry or bigotry. This course considers a range of philosophical perspectives on love at the intersection of ethics and aesthetics. The approach in exploring these perspectives is interdisciplinary: many philosophers turn to fiction and art to not merely illustrate but enrich their accounts of love.

It includes a comparative analysis of Africa’s partnership(s) with the different regions of the world (broadly categorized into East and West, Global South and Global North) and time spans (broadly grouped into colonial and post-colonial). It also examines processes, actors, events and partnerships within independent Africa and how they have contributed to the present state of the continent, which observers have described as rising. The course interrogates this observation. How truly is “Africa rising”? What is the cost of the rise? What does it mean for individuals, states and the entire continent? Why/how does it matter? The course focuses on these (and other important) questions, considering examples from various sectors, events, countries, bilateral and multilateral arrangements with African states and in relation to the rest of the world.

Is it relevant? Should we even care? Is it important? Does it even matter? The assumption is YES, and we will examine this hypothesis by exploring academic journal articles, learning from case discussions and rom experiences of entrepreneurs including my/yourself. After all, Entrepreneurial Though and Action (ET&A) will not necessarily make any given effort more successful (at least no research so far). ET&A does not guarantee success; some (but not all) will fail. But knowing how and under what conditions “failure can be good”, employing ET&A will enable more individuals to try, try sooner, often fail sooner, try more times/multiple simultaneous ventures thus making personal success more likely and sooner. These in turn will increase the aggregate number of successful ventures for society as a whole. In essence, the course will shed positive light on the dark side of entrepreneurship. There is often good in failure-how so? There is often a better way to fail- how so? Entrepreneurship permeated Babson College; it is considered the liberal arts of business education.

Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship (ADE) is an international, experiential social entrepreneurship and design course where students work in partnership with communities in India, Ghana, Morocco and Alabama to co-create and test innovation concepts and sustainable business models. The focus is on income generation and meeting daily human needs through new product and service design and development but the scope considers the cultural appropriateness of design choices and their impact on social venture success. This includes how design can impact the desirability and viability of innovations in different problem-opportunity contexts, examined in the innovation phases of observation, conception, strategic planning and implementation.A joint offering by Babson and Olin College, the course integrates core elements of user-oriented collaborative design and engineering design with entrepreneurial opportunity shaping and venture strategy. Babson and Olin College students work collaboratively in cross-functional teams to exploit their respective expertise and strengths. Starting with ethnographic research, venture teams collaborate first-hand with local communities on focused issues to identify addressable problems and to evaluate and test potential innovation solutions. Mixing entrepreneurship and design pedagogies, the course takes a systems view considering how design choices in product/service design and business model design can enhance-or diminish-a social venture's impact.The course is run as a virtual firm where students work on distributed teams to develop social ventures by engaging with partner organizations, prioritizing programs, and setting and pursing goals while deploying modest amounts of seed capital.

How do waste issues relate to broader structural injustices? How can we reimagine solutions for environmental justice? By thinking critically about these questions, we will challenge our thinking about consumption, justice and the meaning of waste, and why it matters today and in the future.

The city’s distinct pioneering spirit coupled with its climate of social activism (not to mention its seismically unstable geography) make it a unique, exciting metropolis and an ideal home for artists looking to push the boundaries of their form.  This course will examine theater performance focused on, inspired by, or born in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area.  We will study a wide variety of plays and discuss how and why the City by the Bay serves as the ideal setting, subject, performance locale, and, sometimes, character in the works.  We will investigate the artistic process and understand the historical context when these plays went from page to stage.  We will see how theater artists, inspired by fierce political battles, attempted to rally their audiences to action and elicit social change with their works.

Where does it come from, what does it ask of us, and how might it alter our minds, bodies, values, and/or relations? In this course, we will examine love’s meanings as conceived and contested by influential writers across a range of cultural contexts. Focusing primarily on erotic love (erôs), we will discuss how such meanings relate to notions of art, beauty, conjugality, legality, sexuality, spirituality, and transgression, both in their original era and our own. Particular attention will be paid to how differences of race, class, age, gender, and authority operate as incitements to, and/or impediments of, relations of love and eroticism. Authors to be studied include Ovid, Plato, Shakespeare, Wilde, Hurston, Duras, Garcia Marquez, Kundera, Chretien de Troyes, and Marie de France, with readings supplemented by contemporary films such as Carol, The Lunchbox, Moonlight, and Her. In addition to weekly reading assignments, students will: complete daily quizzes, compose two short essays (one analytical, one creative), participate in two group presentations, and sit for a final exam.

Over the last 30 years, the idealized goal of drug discovery has been to identify a specific chemical substance that is highly specific for a single molecular target and arrests or stems the advancement of disease.  Although the goal is highly specific and the process seems linear, there are many contributing, and often unforeseen factors that inform drug design, the drug development pipeline and the eventual success or failure of a given drug candidate.  In this course, we will take a systems approach to identify and describe all of the contributing elements of identifying, characterizing and bringing a drug to market, to define the physiological, biological, economic and regulatory systems that characterize the process and to outline the social, economic and environmental considerations of a sustainable and productive model for drug development.

Although bandits, are by the very definition, law-breakers, their social, political, and economic role is often far more complicated. Bandits do more than just operate in the “underworld,” they often challenge the state and it’s legitimacy to rule. As a result, the bandit, and the myths and histories around them, become a lens to criticize and question the authority, or lack thereof, of the state and similar institutions throughout history. We will examine, not only the history of the bandit and the underworld, but in a deeper vein, the entanglements between licit and illicit markets, of law, police, and prison systems, of wealth and poverty, and of the the role and influence of the state in shaping the conditions that give rise to the bandit and outlaw.Prerequisite: RHT1000 and RHT1001; AHS1000 and Any combination of 3 Intermediate Liberal arts (HSS/LVA/CVA)",History & Society,"Aug 23, 2018",14 of 20,14,"Bradford, James",Park Manor North Focsle,Undergraduate,B01, Summer 2018,Second Session,"Jul 5, 2018",2018, 9:45AM-12:55PM,Summer,BANDITS:CRIME AND PUNISHMENT THROUGH HIS

Not included: Tuition, international flight, visa costs, additional meals and personal expenses. The program fee is paid to the Glavin Office.This course is framed as “City as Text” because the city becomes our laboratory and our classroom - an extended text not limited to what is housed in a library; rather we will learn first-hand through direct encounters with each city’s public places and often more hidden histories. Approaching these two cities from a design thinking perspective, each day includes explorative mapping of the city as a source and outgrowth of invention and creativity. In this course, we will consider the social and political history of both cities by actively examining the characteristics and innovations of their urban spaces. Why is each city designed as it is? How has it changed, and in response to what factors? We will delve critically into how Barcelona and Madrid have sought to market or “brand” their images, and – delving into the cityscape – what constitutes genuine tradition versus touristic or nationalistic myths. Students will conduct field research in various neighborhoods, using strategies like trendspotting and coolhunting to consider how the use of urban space and its potential are being redefined through restaurants and food markets, art and architecture, fashion and culture, and smart uses of technology.  A key part of this course for students will be the opportunity participate in their own choice of what to “read” -- neighborhood mapping; observation decision making; which foods to try; interesting pathways.Mandatory Dates:Monday, April 9, 2018 6:30-8:30 PMMonday, April 23, 2018 6:30-8:30 PMMonday, April 30, 2018 6:30-8:30 PMTravel: Monday, May 14 - Thursday May 24, 2018 *NEW RETURN DATEPost-Travel: TBD",Arts & Humanities,"Jul 6, 2018",17 of 0,17,"Elective, AbroadRademacher, Virginia", ,Undergraduate,A01, Summer 2018,First Session,"May 21, 2018",2018,,Summer,THE CITY AS TEXT: BARCELONA AND MADRID

In sum, we will explore how concepts that contribute to our understanding of individual and communal responsibility might be revisited and redefined in the effort to create a world that offers sustainable economic opportunity for all, ensured within a vital commitment to environmental stewardship.    Prerequisites:  RHT and AHSThis course may be offered Spring or a Summer semester",Arts & Humanities,"Jul 6, 2018",0 of 0,0,"CANCEL, CANCELGraham, Michelle",Babson 203,Undergraduate,A01, Summer 2018,First Session,"May 21, 2018",2018, 1:15PM- 4:25PM,Summer,NARRATIVES OF SUSTAINABILITY

In particular, this narrative is largely dominated by the two great wars and the Cold War. However, what made those conflicts so important was not just their impact on Europe and the Western World, but how those conflicts catalyzed mass movements globally.  This class examines the history of decolonization and revolution in the 20th Century, and how the world wars and the Cold War impacted processes of nationalism, independence, decolonization and revolution. Starting with the rise of Turkey and the Bolshevik revolution during the first world war, we will then analyze the independence movements that sprouted from the vestiges of the second world war, particularly those of China and India, as well as the emergence of Apartheid in South Africa. We will also explore the impact of the Cold War on revolution and decolonization, especially Vietnam and Algeria. Finally, the course will analyze how more recent revolutions, such as those in Iran and Israel /Palestine, are rooted in longer historical processes which highlight the continuing legacy of Imperialism and revolutionary resistance to imperialism in the contemporary world.  The course will use a variety of books, articles, movies, and music to analyze this deep, violent, and often conflicted aspect of human history.Pre-requisites:  AHS and RHT ",History & Society,"Aug 23, 2018",14 of 30,14,"Bradford, James",Park Manor North Focsle,Undergraduate,B01, Summer 2018,Second Session,"Jul 5, 2018",2018, 1:15PM- 4:25PM,Summer,DECOLONIZATION & REVOLUTION 20TH CENT

You will compare the intentions and effects of short stories that create entire worlds and those that are more elliptical and fragmentary, though they hint at more.  You will learn the formal elements of the short story, such as characterization and point-of-view, and also trace the development of literary theories, those critical lenses that will increase your understanding and enrich your appreciation.

Raw materials are not available in infinite quantities; neither are human labor and productive capital.   Managers must deal with real-world constraints in making decisions about production and pricing, while consumers are subject to the constraints of income and prices in satisfying their needs and wants. Governments must set basic rules for an economy, provide certain goods and services, and deal with issues of taxation, income distribution and inequality when determining how a country’s resources will be used and who benefits from those resources.  The Microeconomics curriculum introduces us to the rules and principles that help guide allocation decisions, and focuses particularly on the role of markets. Topics include the interaction of supply and demand in the determination of prices, demand and supply elasticities, rational choice theory, costs and efficient methods of production, market structure, wage determination, game theory for understanding firm interdependence, pricing strategy, and the role of government in correcting externalities and addressing other market failures.
